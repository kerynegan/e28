## Outside resources
### Functionality 
+ [This StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44681646/the-page-will-strangely-refresh-when-i-click-the-button) which helped me figure out why my page kept reloading on submit of my buttons. 
+ And [this related documentation from Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) which further explained the functionality.
+ [This page](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html) on v-model binding modifiers.
+ I re-reviewed the v-if/v-if-else conditionals on [this page](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/conditional.html).
### Styling
+ *UPDATE:* I removed this after adding Bootstrap styling, but leaving the reference here for completeness: I heavily used [this tooltips styling page from W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp) for the hover effects on the game tallies.
+ *UPDATE:* I didn't use this after all: I didn't realize we could easily [use strings for list-style-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) until this project. 
+ Added some Bootstrap CSS styling and referenced [that documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/).
+ In particular, I heavily referenced the Bootstrap styling documentation for [gutters](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/gutters/) and [spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/), but ultimately ended up fixing them with manual padding/margin styles on the col-md-9.
+ Styling guide for making radio selections look like buttons [from Mark Heath](https://markheath.net/post/customize-radio-button-css). (I was inspired by the demo-ed Heads or Tails game that used pictures for radio buttons in class)
+ [Google fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lora:wght@700&family=Merriweather&display=swap) Lora and Merriweather
+ [Favicon generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) saved me from the rabbit hole I fall into every time I open Photoshop and got rid of that annoying little '404 ico not found' warning.
