# Project 1
+ By: Keryn Egan
+ Production URL: <http://e28p1.yourdomain.com>

## Outside resources
+ [This StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44681646/the-page-will-strangely-refresh-when-i-click-the-button) which helped me figure out why my page kept reloading on submit of my buttons. 
+ And [this related documentation from Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) which further explained the functionality.
+ [This page](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html) on v-model binding modifiers.
+ I re-reviewed the v-if/v-if-else conditionals on [this page](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/conditional.html).
+ I heavily used [this tooltips styling page from W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp) for the hover effects on the game tallies.
+ I didn't realize we could easily [use strings for list-style-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) until this project. 
+ Added some Bootstrap CSS styling and referenced [that documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/).
