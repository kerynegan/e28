##Week 2 Assignment - JavaScript Game

**Plan:** Create a mouse-controlled solo pong game using the HTML Canvas function.

Initial thoughts:

- [x] Create HTML bones, connect js and css files. Need canvas and start button
- [x] Game should begin by clicking the button.
- [ ] Two paddles, one each on left and right, will move along Y-axis, controlled by the mouse movements.
- [ ] A ball will start at center and move in a random direction. It will be confined vertically inside the Canvas, but can go off the Canvas boundaries on either side.
- [ ] The ball will be repelled by the inside edges of the two paddles.
- [ ] The ball's speed(direction) will reverse when it bounces off the paddle.
- [ ] When it bounces, it will reverse angles. Consider problem of continuous straight bounces back and forth?
- [ ] If the ball falls off the Canvas, the game is over.
- [ ] If the game goes on too long, should the ball's speed increase?
- [ ] Should there be a points counter for each successful bounce?
